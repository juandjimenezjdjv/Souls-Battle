# Souls Battle - C++ University Project

The "Souls Battle" project is a C++ programming exercise designed for university students. It provides an opportunity for students to work with various data structures while simulating the struggle between heaven and hell for the souls of humans in the world. The primary objective is to allow students to practice and understand fundamental data structures such as trees, hash tables, lists, and heaps, all while developing an interactive narrative that involves decision-making based on the characteristics of souls.

## Features

- Interactive Narrative: Engage in a compelling narrative that involves decision-making based on the unique characteristics of souls.
- Data Structures Practice: The project provides hands-on experience with essential data structures, including trees, hash tables, lists, and heaps.
